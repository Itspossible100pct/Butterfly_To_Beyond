# Butterfly to Beyond - Prototype
With some brain crunching work, I had much fun working on this tiny part of one of my passion projects.  Fun fact: all character voices and music created by me.

I focussed on hand tracking, character interactions, visuals and sound with this one. I created the creature behaviors with a state machine.  I also got to learn more about animations, Blender software and spent more time with sound integration.  

Using Unity and a lot of heaving coding with C# and Meta SDKs.    
My goal was to make it within 7 days, but in my case it took 10 days because I found the state machine quite challenging as it being my first time.  I'm proud of myself for pushing through.  It feels so rewarding!

"Butterfly to Beyond" is a story-driven VR experience that plunges players into the life cycle of a butterfly, promoting personal growth through interactive storytelling and immersive gameplay. Players nurture a butterfly from egg to caterpillar, then step into its cocoon during metamorphosis, and finally aid its emergence and flight, each phase enriched with a unique musical score.
